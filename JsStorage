Q1:- What is Web Storage
ans:- Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser.
 The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.

 a)Local storage: It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
 b)Session storage: It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

 A)explanation of local storage:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>

</head>
<body>
    <h3 id="first"></h3>
    <button onclick="myStorageInfo()">Add</button>
    <button onclick="RemoveInfo()">Remove</button>
   <script>
    let storeData=document.getElementById("first")
   let myvalues={name:"aniket",age:25}


// function for setitem
  function myStorageInfo(){
// it is used to store the data to localstorage

when we store any object to localstorage we need to convert to stringfy
    localStorage.setItem("userinfo",JSON.stringify(myvalues))


//
when we retrive the data means show the data we use getitem and need 
to parse to show we can show output in object
   const storeInfo= JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("userinfo"))
   const {name,age}=storeInfo
 
   storeData.textContent=`Name:${name} Address:${age}`
  }

  function RemoveInfo(){
    localStorage.removeItem("userinfo")
    storeData.textContent=""
  }


B):- Session Storage 
the method is same as for localstorage but the
saved data remove after the browser tab is closed.

Q3:-Cookies:A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by 
your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs. 
For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,

Why do you need a Cookie
Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,

When a user visits a web page, the user profile can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user profile.

// for create cookies
document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC";

// for give page about to store
document.cookie = "username=John; path=/services";
// for delet cookies
document.cookie =
  "username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
   </script> 
</body>
</html>
